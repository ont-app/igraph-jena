    This ontology pertains to representations of Chinese Lexical
    information, particularly to RDF translations of CEDICT, available
    from
    <https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/export/cedict/cedict_1_0_ts_utf-8_mdbg.txt.gz>,
    Discussed at <https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict>
      
    Licenced under <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>.

    Per the conditions of said license, this RDF representation is
    licensed under the same terms.

    Chinese has a couple of peculiarities. Its written form extends
    over a number of dialects with radically different
    pronunciations. There is no morphology to speak of, so each form
    is canonical. Part-of-speech also tends to be fluid and
    context-dependent.

    CEDICT's English representations are descriptions, some subset of
    these descriptions may be aligned to English lexica, but this file
    renders these descriptions as 'glosses'.
     
    The following new constructs are defined:
    * zh:Cedict, naming the lexicon
    * zh:ChineseForm, subsumed by ontolex:Form
    * zh:CedictEntry, a ontolex:LexicalEntry in zh:Cedict.
    * natlex:inLexicon owl:inverseOf lime:entry, to facilitate definintion of 
      zh:CedictEntry
    * A new subclass of zh:ChineseForm is defined for every written 
      form, restricted in its ontolex:writtenRep, instances of which
      should provide pronunciations within and across dialects.
    * zh:label, a subproperty of rdfs:label providing fast access to each
      written form.
    * zh:MandarinForm a subclass of said new subclass, with ontolex:pron
      defined with a zh:pinyin specification.
    * zh:pinyin, a sub-property of ontolex:phoneticRep, specifying pinyin
    * en:gloss, an English description of each lexical sense.
    
    These Ontolex constructs are used directly:
    * ontolex:sense
    * ontolex:LexicalSense, each instance of which is given an en:gloss
      assertion (see description below) Each lexical sense is named
      with a numeric #-fragment appended to its corresponding
      ChineseForm.

    CEDICT provides written forms in both simplified and traditional
    forms.  The simplified form, being the offical form for the
    People's Republic of China, are tagged as @zh. When the
    traditional form for an entry differs from the simplied form, a
    second writtenRep assertion is made, tagged as @zh-Hant.

    Namespaces

    The following namespaces are introduced (with suggested prefixes):

       For each lexical entry, a subclass dedicated to the written

        lex:writtenRep.  Forms in specific dialects or variations in
        pronunciation within the same dialect should then be instances
        of this class, specifying pronunciation with a sub-property of
        ontolex:phoneticRep.
